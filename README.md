# Hello, World! 

## Hallo Welt! Saluton Mondo! Bonjour Monde ! Zdravo svete!

My name is Emmanuel Bosquet aka Keksoj (=cookies in esperanto).
I am a software developer. I've worked as such at [Clever Cloud](clever-cloud.com/) where I mainly worked on the open-source, Rust-written, reverse proxy called [Sōzu](https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu).

I like Rust. It is my first language.

A definite part of coding, in my opinion, is to write documentation.
Readmes are my creed, markdown is my holy sword.
I am embarked on a journey to make code ever more clear and readable, so that even a jerk like me can understand it.

Aside from programming, I love drawing geometry, speaking languages (especially german) and playing guitar.
